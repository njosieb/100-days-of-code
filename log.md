### Day 2: April 3, 2019 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Background images on Sections & Adding Icons

**Thoughts**: Day #2 of #100DaysOfCode I continued on the wedding website & worked on creating depth in each section, so I played around with background images in certain sections. I also added icons to each of the section titles, I might edit them out, but I'm trying to see if I like them :)

### Day 5: April 6, 2019 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Figuring out which divs to put borders on, adjusting existing border colors

**Thoughts**: Day #5 of #100DaysOfCode involved a lot of trial and error regarding whether or not to give certain elements a border and, if so, which color... I also considered existing borders and whether or not their border color should be edited. Small edits, but big difference!
