# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 2, 2019 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Container Classes & Links

**Thoughts:** For the first day of the #100DaysOfCode challenge I worked on a wedding website Iâ€™m building! My focus today was on adding container classes to the sections, designing layout of different parts & making sure all of my links were working like they should

**Today's Progress**: Background images on Sections & Adding Icons

**Thoughts**: Day #2 of #100DaysOfCode I continued on the wedding website & worked on creating depth in each section, so I played around with background images in certain sections. I also added icons to each of the section titles, I might edit them out, but I'm trying to see if I like them :)
