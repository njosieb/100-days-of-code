**Today's Progress**: Background images on Sections & Adding Icons

**Thoughts**: Day #2 of #100DaysOfCode I continued on the wedding website & worked on creating depth in each section, so I played around with background images in certain sections. I also added icons to each of the section titles, I might edit them out, but I'm trying to see if I like them :)

**Today's Progress**: Figuring out which divs to put borders on, adjusting existing border colors

**Thoughts**: Day #5 of #100DaysOfCode involved a lot of trial and error regarding whether or not to give certain elements a border and, if so, which color... I also considered existing borders and whether or not their border color should be edited. Small edits, but big difference!

**Thoughts**: Day #9 of #100DaysOfCode went quickly because I spent most of my time figuring out how to adjust the height & width of an element in one of the sections. Doesn't sound like it should have taken me so much time, but I'm not surprised lol I also played around with icon colors
