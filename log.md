### Day 1: April 2, 2019 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Container Classes & Links

**Thoughts:** For the first day of the #100DaysOfCode challenge I worked on a wedding website Iâ€™m building! My focus today was on adding container classes to the sections, designing layout of different parts & making sure all of my links were working like they should

### Day 2: April 3, 2019 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Background images on Sections & Adding Icons

**Thoughts**: Day #2 of #100DaysOfCode I continued on the wedding website & worked on creating depth in each section, so I played around with background images in certain sections. I also added icons to each of the section titles, I might edit them out, but I'm trying to see if I like them :)

**Today's Progress**: Added 2 Buttons, Icons, Made another color variable.

**Thoughts**: Day #3 of #100DaysOfCode focused on making buttons & trying to figure out how to style them. Had more fun adding icons that went well with them. Played around w/ background colors to also help with depth of site. We'll see how long they last til I change them lol #StayTuned

**Thoughts**: Day #4 of #100DaysOfCode was spent working on fixing spacing in navbar, adjusting fonts for better readability & trying to find out how to erase the background of some images to allow for the background color of a section to show all around it... still a work in progress...
