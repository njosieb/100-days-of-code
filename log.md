### Day 2: April 3, 2019 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Background images on Sections & Adding Icons

**Thoughts**: Day #2 of #100DaysOfCode I continued on the wedding website & worked on creating depth in each section, so I played around with background images in certain sections. I also added icons to each of the section titles, I might edit them out, but I'm trying to see if I like them :)

### Day 5: April 6, 2019 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Figuring out which divs to put borders on, adjusting existing border colors

**Thoughts**: Day #5 of #100DaysOfCode involved a lot of trial and error regarding whether or not to give certain elements a border and, if so, which color... I also considered existing borders and whether or not their border color should be edited. Small edits, but big difference!

**Today's Progress**: Created a container component that was applied to all of the sections.

**Thoughts**: Day #7 of #100DaysOfCode I researched how to created a container component & was able to created & apply it in all of the sections of site. This took the place of a container class I had set in each section. Also made new list of future plans for the site. #brainstorm

**Today's Progress**: Figuring out how to adjust the logos in the registry section, changing colors of the icons in the section titles.

**Thoughts**: Day #9 of #100DaysOfCode went quickly because I spent most of my time figuring out how to adjust the height & width of an element in one of the sections. Doesn't sound like it should have taken me so much time, but I'm not surprised lol I also played around with icon colors

### Day 10: April 11, 2019 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Added hover grow effect, Added hover effect to other elements that are supposed to be clicked on.

**Thoughts**: Day #10 of #100DaysOfCode I worked on adding hover classes to buttons and other things which are supposed to be clicked. I also made it so the arrow turns into the hand selector so the user will know that it is clickable. #clickbait #clickMe

### Day 11: April 12, 2019 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Looking into how to make buttons look better.

**Thoughts**: Day #11 of #100DaysOfCode was pretty uneventful as I was mainly trying to figure out how to add buttons to each clickable items while making them look more interesting than usual

**Today's Progress**: Changed picture in hotel section, Fixes hover on elements that don't need it. Added hover to NJH Designs

**Thoughts**: Lucky Day #13 of #100DaysOfCode Was filled with editing of pictures, adjusting hover-grow classes throughout the sections and to my name in the footer. I played around with background colors for the picture captions, but it just didn't go. #ohwell

### Day 14: April 15, 2019 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Added div to eventually add a way-point that transitions into a sticky header as the user scrolls down the site.

**Thoughts**: Day #14 of #100DaysOfCode Added a div at the bottom of the header section that will eventually be used as a Vue way-point in order to transition it to a fixed navbar when user scrolls down the site. (terminology might be off in my description, but I know what I'm about!)

**Today's Progress**: Adjusted colors on section title, played around with adjusting heights & widths of the schedule section text as well. Looking more into way points as well.

**Today's Progress**: Updated lots of information on site, brought section titles into box in each section, created lighter and darker colors to use throughout site, Added photo border which helps with color cohesion.

**Thoughts**: Day #16 of #100DaysOfCode Added lots of updated information from the bride who I'm building the site for, which makes it seem more relevant & excites me that one day real soon, people are going to be interacting with it! I also played around with colors & fun stuff like that.

### Day 17: April 18, 2019 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Added input field for song suggestions, edited buttons

**Thoughts**: Day #17 of #100DaysOfCode I got to play around with adding a form that the Bride wants for suggesting songs for the reception. Even though it will evolve eventually into a pop-up modal, I was able to incorporate it into what was already on the site.

### Day 21: April 22, 2019 Monday

### Day 22: April 23, 2019 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Looked up text modals to use for my buttons

**Thoughts**: Its really hard to read documentation when trying to learn about something and try to implement into an already existing project because nothing ever look like what you think it will. It's like taking 1 step forward and 3 steps back, simply because it feels like a waste of time.

### Day 23: April 24, 2019 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Not much...

**Thoughts**: Spent an embarassasingly long time trying to figure out how to change padding/margin and then realized I didn't like how it looked after all.

### Day 24: April 25, 2019 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Learned difference between live site and local site changes lol... big deal... played with colors and stuff

**Thoughts**: Day #24 of #100DaysOfCode I learned a valuable lesson about making sure I knew which version of the website I was looking at while trying to make changes... turns out checking live site for changes made to local site will only end in frustration. #TheMoreYouKnow

### Day 25: April 26, 2019 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Added sticky header and routing to various sections throughout the site, from the Navbar

**Thoughts**: Day #25 of #100DaysOfCode Learned how to add a sticky header and navigation to each of the sections from nuxt-links in the navbar!

### Day 26: April 27, 2019 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Added sticky header's functionality and learned about lodash method library

**Thoughts**: Day #26 of #100DaysOfCode was pretty fun because I was able to add functionality to the sticky header so that it gets a background color as soon as the user scrolls! I also made sure that the function doesn't interfere with performance of site

### Day 27: April 28, 2019 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Created more color variables to use for nav bar, added classes to nav-links, added z-index in wedding party section to make navbar stay on top of it.

**Thoughts**: Day #27 of #100DaysOfCode was all about color variables, adding classes to the nav-bar links and making sure that the nav-bar stayed above any content as you scrolled through the page.

### Day 28: April 29, 2019 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Made more color variables, reorganized the polaroids in each section by either taking out things that should be outside of the white frame or making sure that all information fits in the white parts of the polaroid... making it more coherent.

**Thoughts**: Days #28 OF #100DaysofCode I made even more colors & tried to reorganize divs used throughout site so that they are more cohesive. Fun to see how making "little" tweaks makes a big difference as I work towards making it look like I want it to #workinprogress #emphasisonPROGRESS

### Day 29: April 30, 2019 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Added border bottom to navbar, Changed picture of Church

**Thoughts**: Day #29 of #100DaysOfCode brought with it an exciting, albeit small, feature of putting a bottom border on the sticky header. It really looks great throughout the page and makes it look cohesive.. at least so far
