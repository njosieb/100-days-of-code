**Today's Progress**: Container Classes & Links

### Day 2: April 3, 2019 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Background images on Sections & Adding Icons

**Thoughts**: Day #2 of #100DaysOfCode I continued on the wedding website & worked on creating depth in each section, so I played around with background images in certain sections. I also added icons to each of the section titles, I might edit them out, but I'm trying to see if I like them :)

### Day 5: April 6, 2019 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Figuring out which divs to put borders on, adjusting existing border colors

**Thoughts**: Day #5 of #100DaysOfCode involved a lot of trial and error regarding whether or not to give certain elements a border and, if so, which color... I also considered existing borders and whether or not their border color should be edited. Small edits, but big difference!

### Day 6: April 7, 2019 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Editing fonts styles & sizes, Adding Icons & adjusting colors and styles of existing icons. Looking more into how to make a text modal.

**Thoughts**: Day #6 of #100DaysOfCode I worked on editing the fonts styles & sizes of the wedding website. I also worked with adding icons and editing ones that are already on the page. Finally, I started looking up how to make a text modal.

### Day 7: April 8, 2019 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Created a container component that was applied to all of the sections.

**Thoughts**: Day #7 of #100DaysOfCode I researched how to created a container component & was able to created & apply it in all of the sections of site. This took the place of a container class I had set in each section. Also made new list of future plans for the site. #brainstorm

**Thoughts**: Holy Day #8 of #100DaysOfCode Batman! I added the footer, fixed text-alignment in the Navbar, Made background of sections more cohesive with the border-shadow effect. Still working on how to make the registry pictures work...

### Day 9: April 10, 2019 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Figuring out how to adjust the logos in the registry section, changing colors of the icons in the section titles.

**Thoughts**: Day #9 of #100DaysOfCode went quickly because I spent most of my time figuring out how to adjust the height & width of an element in one of the sections. Doesn't sound like it should have taken me so much time, but I'm not surprised lol I also played around with icon colors

### Day 10: April 11, 2019 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Added hover grow effect, Added hover effect to other elements that are supposed to be clicked on.

**Thoughts**: Day #10 of #100DaysOfCode I worked on adding hover classes to buttons and other things which are supposed to be clicked. I also made it so the arrow turns into the hand selector so the user will know that it is clickable. #clickbait #clickMe

### Day 11: April 12, 2019 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Looking into how to make buttons look better.

**Thoughts**: Day #11 of #100DaysOfCode was pretty uneventful as I was mainly trying to figure out how to add buttons to each clickable items while making them look more interesting than usual

**Today's Progress**: Added buttons throughout site, Tweaked certain things to make site more cohesive.

**Today's Progress**: Changed picture in hotel section, Fixes hover on elements that don't need it. Added hover to NJH Designs

**Thoughts**: Lucky Day #13 of #100DaysOfCode Was filled with editing of pictures, adjusting hover-grow classes throughout the sections and to my name in the footer. I played around with background colors for the picture captions, but it just didn't go. #ohwell

### Day 14: April 15, 2019 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Added div to eventually add a way-point that transitions into a sticky header as the user scrolls down the site.

**Thoughts**: Day #14 of #100DaysOfCode Added a div at the bottom of the header section that will eventually be used as a Vue way-point in order to transition it to a fixed navbar when user scrolls down the site. (terminology might be off in my description, but I know what I'm about!)

### Day 15: April 16, 2019 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Adjusted colors on section title, played around with adjusting heights & widths of the schedule section text as well. Looking more into way points as well.

**Today's Progress**: Updated lots of information on site, brought section titles into box in each section, created lighter and darker colors to use throughout site, Added photo border which helps with color cohesion.

**Thoughts**: Day #16 of #100DaysOfCode Added lots of updated information from the bride who I'm building the site for, which makes it seem more relevant & excites me that one day real soon, people are going to be interacting with it! I also played around with colors & fun stuff like that.

### Day 17: April 18, 2019 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Added input field for song suggestions, edited buttons

**Thoughts**: Day #17 of #100DaysOfCode I got to play around with adding a form that the Bride wants for suggesting songs for the reception. Even though it will evolve eventually into a pop-up modal, I was able to incorporate it into what was already on the site.

### Day 22: April 23, 2019 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Looked up text modals to use for my buttons

**Thoughts**: Its really hard to read documentation when trying to learn about something and try to implement into an already existing project because nothing ever look like what you think it will. It's like taking 1 step forward and 3 steps back, simply because it feels like a waste of time.

### Day 23: April 24, 2019 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Not much...

**Thoughts**: Spent an embarassasingly long time trying to figure out how to change padding/margin and then realized I didn't like how it looked after all.

### Day 24: April 25, 2019 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Learned difference between live site and local site changes lol... big deal... played with colors and stuff

**Thoughts**: Day #24 of #100DaysOfCode I learned a valuable lesson about making sure I knew which version of the website I was looking at while trying to make changes... turns out checking live site for changes made to local site will only end in frustration. #TheMoreYouKnow

**Thoughts**: Day #26 of #100DaysOfCode was pretty fun because I was able to add functionality to the sticky header so that it gets a background color as soon as the user scrolls! I also made sure that the function doesn't interfere with performance of site

### Day 27: April 28, 2019 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Created more color variables to use for nav bar, added classes to nav-links, added z-index in wedding party section to make navbar stay on top of it.

### Day 28: April 29, 2019 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Made more color variables, reorganized the polaroids in each section by either taking out things that should be outside of the white frame or making sure that all information fits in the white parts of the polaroid... making it more coherent.

**Thoughts**: Days #28 OF #100DaysofCode I made even more colors & tried to reorganize divs used throughout site so that they are more cohesive. Fun to see how making "little" tweaks makes a big difference as I work towards making it look like I want it to #workinprogress #emphasisonPROGRESS

### Day 29: April 30, 2019 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Added border bottom to navbar, Changed picture of Church

**Thoughts**: Day #29 of #100DaysOfCode brought with it an exciting, albeit small, feature of putting a bottom border on the sticky header. It really looks great throughout the page and makes it look cohesive.. at least so far

### Day 30: May 1, 2019 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Was able to regroup and refocus my attention on tangible tasks that I should be working on instead of going by the seat of my pants.

**Thoughts**:Day #30 of #100DaysOfCode Not so much actual coding happening today but more regrouping and refocusing of attention on what I should be working on instead of just going by the seat of my pants.

### Day 31: May 2, 2019 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Making the header background picture jive with the text that is on top of it in both the "top of the screen" position and what the background color is when you scroll!

**Thoughts**: Day #31 of #100DaysOfCode I had a breakthrough while working with font color & accessibility with the contrasting colors of both a background photo (when at a certain position) and the sticky header (when user is scrolling)! Very exciting!

### Day 32: May 3, 2019 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Continuing to fine-tune the color story throughout the site because of the new header background picture.

**Thoughts**: Day #32 of #100DaysOfCode Made sure the changes I made yesterday made sense & were coherent with the rest of the site. I took the main color of the new header image & made it the background color for some sections of the site to help lighten the whole thing up quite a bit.

### Day 34: May 5, 2019 Sunday

### Day 35: May 6, 2019 Monday

**Thoughts**: Day #35 of #100DDaysOfCode Learned how to change the title of the site, in the specific way Nuxt needs it to be done. At first I thought this would be easy-peasy, based on how I learned to do it in regular ole html, but easy-peasy & web-dev sometimes don't go together

**Today's Progress**: Adjusted colors of icons and other elements to fit the color story better.

**Today's Progress**: Designed the enter landing page for the user to enter the password to go to the main site!

**Thoughts**: Day #38 of #100DaysOfCode was ALL about designing the landing page for the password protection we are going to have for the website. My focus was to make it feel warm & welcoming so that the user is definitely going to want to know the password to get to see the rest of the site.

### Day 39: May 10, 2019 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Added an error function to the input field when user enters an incorrect password.

**Thoughts**: Day #39 of #100DaysOfCode was all about adding an error notification when user enters an incorrect password. Moral of today's coding sesh: Coding is not for the faint of heart & this particular task almost proved to be too much for this oft-faint-of-heart coder. #justkeepcoding

**Today's Progress**: Made the arrow underneathe the header a nuxt-link to the Schedule section.
